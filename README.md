# Cat vs Dog Classifier using OpenCV and Scikit-learn

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning classifier that differentiates between cats and dogs using traditional ML algorithms. It uses OpenCV to preprocess images and scikit-learn to train and evaluate three classifiers: SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression.

## Features

- Load and preprocess images (resize and flatten)
- Train/test split of dataset
- Train SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression models
- Evaluate accuracy on test set
- Visualize performance using confusion matrix heatmaps with matplotlib and seaborn
